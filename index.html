            How does one punch out the corner of an element and put something in the space created?
        </p>
        <p>
            Answer: you don't, at least not structurally. But the appearance can be achieved very easily just by using
            floated elements and, when necessary, some tiny negative margins. In this example, I've wrapped the "Q" in a
            <code class="language-css">div</code> of its own and then floated the <code class="language-css">div</code> over. Then I give the float some nice
            padding and margins, and center the character. Finally, I set thick white borders on the float, which
            matches nicely with the white document background-- but only the right and bottom borders are made thick.
            The top and left borders are set to zero. To wit:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css line-numbers" id="typewriter">div#punch {
    float: left;
    font-size: 500%;
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    width: 1.2em;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.1em 0;
    background: #346;
    color: white;
    border: solid white 1px;
    border-width: 0 0.2em 0.2em 0;
    margin: 0 0.5em 0.2em 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            It all adds up to the appearance of a block that's had a corner punched out and replaced, and the text in
            the block reflowed to go around the punchout. And, in a sense, that's exactly what happened. But what if I
            want to put a border around the main block of text? How do I keep it from encircling my punched-out corner?
            Even worse, how do I get that border to run along the edge of the punchout?

        <h2>Boxpunch</h2>
        <p>
            So we can do it after all! (Assuming we aren't using IE5.x/Win or IE6/Win, that is, which isn't able to keep
            up. If you want to see the variant that does work in IE/Win, <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/boxpunch/demo-ie.html">go ahead</a>.) Notice
            how the border of the main <code class="language-css">div</code> is bent out of a rectangle so that it runs inside the floated
            element. Okay, I'm lying. That isn't what's really happening. Instead, I set one-pixel black borders on the
            right and bottom edges of the float, and no border at all on the top and left edges. Then the float is
            pulled one pixel up and one pixel to the left, which is accomplished by setting <code class="language-css">-1px</code> margins on
            those sides. This causes the float to overlap the border set on the main <code class="language-css">div</code>, thus covering up
            the black border with the white background of the float. The code looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css line-numbers">div#main2 {
    border: 1px solid black;
}

div#punch2 {
    float: left; 
    width: 25%; 
    text-align: center; 
    background: white; 
    color: black; 
    border: solid black 1px; 
    border-width: 0 1px 1px 0; 
    padding: 0 10px 5px 0; 
    margin: -1px 25px 10px -1px;
}

div#punch2 img {
    max-width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            As in the <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/curvelicious/demo.html">curvelicious demo</a>, the
            <code class="language-css">h1</code> at the top is simply styled as normal, and its borders and background "slide under" the
            floated element. This is expected behavior in CSS2. If you were to set a left border on the <code class="language-css">h1</code>,
            you'd have to make it at least <code class="language-css">111px</code> wide before it could be seen at all! Well, unless it
            become so tall that it was taller than the float. Then you'd be able to see it below the float. If your
            browser supports text zooming, try increasing the text size until the <code class="language-css">h1</code> is taller than the
            float. You should see what I mean then.

        <div id="punch3">Like this text? It can be yours for just $19.99! But wait! There's more! If you call in the

        <h2>Again with the punching</h2>
        <p>
            Of course, if one is floating elements, then one can float anything, not just images. In this case I've
            floated a <codeclass="language-css">div</code>, but it could have been any text element. The borders and margins are set up just
            like last time. Think of it-- you could put a small navigation panel in that float, or anything else that
            takes your fancy. A quotation, perhaps? How about a small table of icons or decorative images? You could
            just float the table itself and be done. Pretty cool, eh?
        </p>
        <p>
            For that matter, why restrict yourself to floating things into the corner of the box? How about going
            straight to the right or left from within the block?
        </p>

        <div id="punch3b">"Better to stick to what's needed."</div>

        <p>
            It's the same basic principle as before, only this time we need to draw three of the borders and only pull
            the float one pixel to the left. We could keep pulling it one pixel upward as well, but that's no necessary
            here and could (in theory) lead to complications. Better to stick to what's needed. Again, any element could
            be floated, so you could float links for further reading, more decorative images like folder tabs, a list of
            short ideas or points that are related to the main text, a table of figures, or the familiar "pull quote"
            style of taking a short phrase in the text and repeating it in larger text. Like we see here.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css line-numbers">div#punch3b {
    float: right;
    width: 25%;
    text-align: left;
    font-size: 140%;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: italic;
    padding: 1em;
    text-indent: -0.5em;
    background: white;
    color: black;
    border: solid black 1p;
    border-width: 1px 0 1px 1px;
    margin: 0.2em -1px 0.2em 0.5e;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Note that, due to rounding errors, Mozilla (and thus Netscape 6.x) may not move a right-floated element over
            as far as it should be. If you resize your browser window enough times, you'll see a black border appear to
            the right of the pull quote. That's because the float is one pixel too far to the left, and the main
            <code class="language-css">div</code>'s border becomes visible. Hopefully they'll fix that eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are any number of ways this concept could be extended, really. The only limit is your imagination! And
            negative margins don't have to be restricted to floats, either. Consider <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/boxpunch/demo2.html">this fairly
                irregular-looking page</a> and how it's been created. Some floats, some normal-flow elements, a few
            one-pixel negative margins, and you've got some twisty layouts! I just hope Wired doesn't sue me for
            stylistic theft...
